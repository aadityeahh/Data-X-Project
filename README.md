# Data-X-Project InSight

# Problem Statement
*Institutions, workplaces and businesses require reliable systems to get  data on how many visitors enter, leave the store and at what time.
Social distancing is the need of the hour in the Covid-19 pandemic. Our project also helps prevent overcrowding.

*We can do this by keeping track of the number of people in a given space at any given point of time.
*We have used python & openCV code which uses an optical flow tracker to track the person when one enters/leaves the room.

# Dataset Used
